Cross-platform graphics engine (game engine in the future) with no libraries but the ones provided by the os.
Vulkan, DirectX, Metal and a software will be supported, as this engine is supposed to be "self-contained". Only a modern C compiler will hopefully required.
All in pure C with the likelihood of the build system also in C (no makefile) very high.
